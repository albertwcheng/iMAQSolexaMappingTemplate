Please make sure you know the type of solexa output files you have in the solexaOutput directory

If you don't know, there is a script that you can use to "guess" the type. The script is guessFastQTypeForFiles.sh included in the albert-bioinformatics-scripts toolbox (https://github.com/albertwcheng/albert-bioinformatics-scripts)

e.g., for a solexa file s_5_sequence.txt

guessFastQTypeForFiles.sh s_5_sequence.txt
will give you a file s_5_sequence.txt.guess with content:

s_5_sequence.txt        ILLUMINASOLEXA1.3+|SOLEXA|SANGER        BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB    36      36

giving you the name of the file, the guess (in highest to lowest probability of the qual string format) then the sample quality string in the file which determines its highest probability guess, the min length of sequence and max length of sequence in the file

for ILLUMINASOLEXA1.3+, you should run bowtie with the flag --solexa1.3-quals
for SOLEXA, use --solexa-quals
